{{% staticref "files/Bankruptcy_UI.pdf" %}} The Impact of Unemployment Benefits on Personal Bankruptcy Filings: Evidence from Pandemic Unemployment Benefit Expiration{{% /staticref %}}

Abstract: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US federal government expanded unemployment benefits and extended coverage to previously ineligible workers. I study the impact of pandemic era unemployment benefit expiration on personal bankruptcy filings in states that ended these federal programs early. Using both nonlinear and linear difference-in-differences, I find that Chapter 13 filings increased between 12-15%% on average. These findings are consistent with previous findings that documented an increase in employment and an increase in household financial insecurity associated with pandemic relief programs.
